How is it collected? If there were a choice of options, explain how you chose. Provide some basic information about the data set: types of variables, number of records, etc. Describe any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. (suggested: approximately 1 page) Source 1 The first data source comes from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control and includes the number of COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population and the 14-day notification rate of reported deaths per million population by week and country from the 1st week of 2020 till the 39th week of 2021 (7th Oct 2021). This data set has 37036 records in total. Each row contains the corresponding data for a certain day and per country. Specifically, variables included in this data set are country related information-country, country code, and continent (type: string), report type that distinguishes whether it’s cases or deaths-indicator (type: string), time information-year-week (type: datetime), count and statistics-weekly count, rate_14_day, and cumulative (type: numerical). Link: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-national-14-day-notification-rate-covid-19 Source 2 The second data source comes from the United States Census Bureau. It is a full report of the international trade the US participated in from 2020 to 2021. This report not only includes the trading time and trading amount with each trading partner of the US but also records the categories of the trading product. There are in total 31 excel files from this source, with each presented and themed around a particular focus (such as by region, by end-use, by trade type and etc.). We discussed and decided to select 10 files that are most relevant to our investigation topics. Data files from this source are mostly represented in a tabular format. The most common variables are balance of payments (BOP) related numerals such as import, export, and balance in millions of dollars. Depending on the division basis, other variables include countries, goods categories, months and etc. Link: https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html Comment To ensure the reliability and quality of the data, we searched and collected both of our data from either government or public institution website. Chen collected the international trade related data and Chuyang gathered the Covid related data. In searching for possible options, we tried to find data that are not only trustworthy but also comprehensive. Since we hope to take a holistic view on the Covid impact, having information that span across longer time period would be beneficial to answering our questions, so this becomes a dominant criterion in choosing our data source. We thought there might be several issues with our data: For the first data set on Covid, although we pulled it from the authoritative ECDC website, there might still be delays or inaccuracies in recording the information. Especially for underdeveloped regions where circulation of information might not be in a timely manner. For the second source on international trade, we only obtain a subset selection of countries and the time points in certain files are quite limited. This may somehow prevent us from drawing a comparison picture in full. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Describe the process of getting the data into a form in which you could work with it in R. If your code does not lend itself to being including in the .Rmd file, provide a link to the folder or file(s) that contain(s) that code. (suggested: approximately 1/2 page) Covid Data Our first data source on Covid already comes in a handy csv format, so we can directly read it into R. However, an issue with this data set is that it comes in a long format with each country repeated for hundreds of times among the rows. There are also some redundant information which we won’t be using in our analysis - an example of this is the source column since all 37036 entries in this data set have the exact same value for source as “Epidemic intelligence, national weekly data”, which wouldn’t be helpful in this case. So for the transformation, we first split the whole data set into two smaller data sets based on the indicator variable (cases/deaths). For each of the subset, we then used a function to extract the cumulative_count and the weekly_count separately, and also used the pivot_wider() function to transform the data from long to wide format. After the transformation, we also ordered each data set by continent and country names. As a result, we obtained 4 final data sets - “tidy_case_count”, “tidy_case_cum”, “tidy_death_count”, “tidy_death_cum”. As suggested by their names, these are the weekly count and cumulative count for cases and deaths respectively. In these four data sets, each row represents a single country (or a continent) and the columns contain 92 week time points from the 1st week of 2020 to the 39th week of 2021. BOP Data Our second data source on international trade is a bit more problematic. The original data comes in as excel files and is therefore not organized as data frame format by itself. There are also quite a bit of notes and annotations written outside of the tables in these files, which we would need to take care of. In order to follow a reproducible workflow, we still tried and succeeded in using R to read in the files and transform it into a more desirable format. One of the major issues with the excel files is that it uses sub headers within the table, which causes inconsistencies in the column/row names and left the tabular form with a lot of blank entries. In order to handle this, we decided to fix these column/row names by pasting the general main headlines and the underlying sub headers together. By doing so, the newly generated column/row names would now contain all the necessary identifying information and we can then organize and clean the enclosing data accordingly. In addition, we removed the annotations and irrelevant entries by specifying the row numbers at which they lie in. We repeated the above steps for each of our 10 selected files with some minor adjustment to fit each case properly. You can find below some details of what our processed data look like: Exhibit 1 - U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services -&gt; int_trade_1 (37 obs. * 10 vars) int_trade_1 has monthly record of Exports, Imports, and Balance for each of Goods, Services, and Total (Goods and Services combined).
