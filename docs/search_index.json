Due to the widespread of this exceedingly contagious epidemic, the international trade bore not only the deficiency of supply triggered by the loss of labor but the impediment of transportation induced by the national lockdowns as well. Therefore, the United States, one of the largest economies in the world, moreover, fell prey to such severe depression. One of the reflective facts is the unprecedented shortage in agricultural goods, a conventionally abundant recourse (The National Law Review, 2021). For instance, as the US Today reported, numerous fast-food suppliers, including McDonald’s, KFC, Wendy’s, and Chick-fil-A, are currently facing meat shortages and hence must discontinue some of their classic products (Tyko, 2021). Therefore, in this project, we decide to compare the spreading map of COVID-19 with the trading routines of the US’s trading partners and therefore explore the relationships between hindrances the US’ international trade is facing and the spread of COVID-19. 1.2 Research Questions Is there any correlation between the declination in international trading of the US and the spread of COVID-19 from Jan 2020 to Sep 2021? Which country’s international trade with the US was mostly affected during this period? Are they also the victims of the COVID-19? Which sort of product or service is most severely affected during this period? Could simply the spread of COVID-19 fully account for this deficient, or there exists other possible triggers? 1.3 Further Insights If solely the spread of COVID-19 could not fully account for the abnormality in international trades, is there any other probably influential factor? 1.4 Reference The National Law Review.

This data set has 37036 records in total. Each row contains the corresponding data for a certain day and per country. Specifically, variables included in this data set are country related information-country, country code, continent, time information-year-week, count and statistics-weekly count, rate_14_day, cumulative, and indicator variable that distinguishes whether it’s cases or deaths-indicator. Table 2.1: Major Columns Used ColumnNames Description country Country name (chr) country_code 3 letter code for country (chr) continent Geographical continent (chr) population Country population (num) indicator Wether it’s ‘cases’ or ‘deaths’ (chr) weekly_count Weekly count of cases or deaths (num) year_week The week number in a Year (chr) cumulative_count Cumulative count of cases or deaths (num) 2.2 International Trade Data from United States Census Bureau Datasets : /ft900xlsx/exh1.xlsx, exh6.xlsx, exh7.xlsx, exh8.xlsx, exh12.xlsx, exh13.xlsx, exh14.xlsx, exh14a.xlsx, exh20.xlsx, exh20a.xlsx, exh20b.xlsx The second data source comes from the United States Census Bureau. It is a full report of the international trade the US participated in from 2020 to 2021. This report not only includes the trading time and trading amount with each trading partner of the US but also records the categories of the trading product. There are in total 31 excel files from this source, with each presented and themed around a particular focus (such as by region, by end-use, by trade type and etc.). We discussed and decided to select 10 files that are most relevant to our investigation topics. Data files from this source are mostly represented in a tabular format. The most common variables are balance of payments (BOP) related numerals such as import, export, and balance in millions of dollars. Depending on the division basis, other variables include countries, goods categories, months and etc. Here are the 10 files that we selected from this source: File # File Name exh1 U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services exh6 U.S. Trade in Goods by Principal End-Use Category exh7 U.S. Exports of Goods by End-Use Category and Commodity exh8 U.S. Imports by End-Use Category and Commodity exh12 U.S. Trade in Goods exh13 U.S. Trade in Goods by Principal End-Use Category exh14a U.S. Trade in Goods by Selected Countries and Areas - Prior Year exh14 U.S. Trade in Goods by Selected Countries and Areas - Current Year exh20 U.S. Trade in Goods and Services by Selected Countries and Areas - BOP Basis exh20a U.S. Trade in Goods by Selected Countries and Areas - BOP Basis exh20b U.S. Trade in Services by Selected Countries and Areas 2.3 Comments and Issues To ensure the reliability and quality of the data, we searched and collected both of our data from either government or public institution website. Chen collected the international trade related data and Chuyang gathered the Covid related data. In searching for possible options, we tried to find data that are not only trustworthy but also comprehensive. Since we hope to take a holistic view on the Covid impact, having information that span across longer time period would be beneficial to answering our questions, so this becomes a dominant criterion in choosing our data source. We thought there might be several issues with our data: For the first data set on Covid, although we pulled it from the authoritative ECDC website, there might still be delays or inaccuracies in recording the information. Especially for underdeveloped regions where circulation of information might not be in a timely manner. For the second source on international trade, we only obtain a subset selection of countries and the time points in certain files are quite limited. This may somehow prevent us from drawing a comparison picture in full. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Covid Data 3.2 BOP Data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Covid Data Our first data source on Covid already comes in a handy csv format, so we can directly read it into R. However, an issue with this data set is that it comes in a long format with each country repeated for hundreds of times among the rows. There are also some redundant information which we won’t be using in our analysis - an example of this is the source column since all 37036 entries in this data set have the exact same value for source as “Epidemic intelligence, national weekly data”, which wouldn’t be helpful in this case. So for the transformation, we first split the whole data set into two smaller data sets based on the indicator variable (cases/deaths). For each of the subset, we then used a function to extract the cumulative_count and the weekly_count separately, and subsequently used the ·pivot_wider()· function to transform the data from long to wide format. After the transformation, we also ordered each data set by continent and country names. As a result, we obtained 4 final data sets - tidy_case_count, tidy_case_cum, tidy_death_count, tidy_death_cum. As suggested by their names, these are the weekly count and cumulative count for cases and deaths respectively. In these four data sets, each row represents a single country (or a continent) and the columns contain 92 week time points from the \\(1^{st}\\) week of 2020 to the \\(39^{th}\\) week of 2021. Generated Data Description tidy_case_count COVID-19 weekly case count tidy_death_count COVID-19 weekly death count tidy_case_cum COVID-19 cumulative case count tidy_death_cum COVID-19 cumulative death count Each of these four data we generate is of dimension 222*95. Each row represents a country or a continent and each column is the statistical count of COVID-19 related data. In our following analysis, we will be using both the geographical and time series data to generate insights. Here’s an example of what the data looks like (a subset of tidy_case_cum): country country_code continent 2020-01-02 2020-01-09 2020-04-23 2020-11-19 2021-09-23 Algeria DZA Africa 0 0 3382 74862 230789 Angola AGO Africa 0 0 26 14493 58603 Benin BEN Africa 0 0 64 2916 23890 Botswana BWA Africa 0 0 22 9594 179220 Burkina Faso BFA Africa 0 0 632 2735 14335 Burundi BDI Africa 0 0 15 662 18529 3.2 BOP Data Our second data source on international trade is a bit more problematic. The original data comes in as excel files and is therefore not organized as data frame format by itself. There are also quite a bit of notes and annotations written outside of the tables in these files, which we would need to take care of. In order to follow a reproducible workflow, we still tried and succeeded in using R to read in the files and transform it into a more desirable format. One of the major issues with the excel files is that it uses sub headers within the table, which causes inconsistencies in the column/row names and left the tabular form with a lot of blank entries. In order to handle this, we decided to fix these column/row names by pasting the general main headlines and the underlying sub headers together. By doing so, the newly generated column/row names would now contain all the necessary identifying information and we can then organize and clean the enclosing data accordingly. In addition, we removed the annotations and irrelevant entries by specifying the row numbers at which they lie in. We repeated the above steps for each of our 10 selected files with some minor adjustment to fit each case properly. You can find below some details of what our processed data look like: 1. Exhibit 1 - U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services -&gt; int_trade_1 (37 obs. * 10 vars) Column Names of int_trade_1: ## [1] &quot;Period&quot; &quot;Balance Total&quot; &quot;Balance Goods (1)&quot; ## [4] &quot;Balance Services&quot; &quot;Exports Total&quot; &quot;Exports Goods (1)&quot; ## [7] &quot;Exports Services&quot; &quot;Imports Total&quot; &quot;Imports Goods (1)&quot; ## [10] &quot;Imports Services&quot; int_trade_1 has monthly record of Exports, Imports, and Balance for each of Goods, Services, and Total (Goods and Services combined). The time period is from Jan. 2019 to Aug. 2021. We will mainly use it to see the fluctuation in the US imports and exports from 2019 to 2021 and compare the balance for goods and services across time. 2. Exhibit 8 - U.S. Imports by End-Use Category and Commodity -&gt; imp_trade_cat (137 obs. * 9 vars) -&gt; imp_trade_tot (6 obs. * 7 vars) ## [1] &quot;Item (1)&quot; &quot;August 2021&quot; &quot;July 2021 (R)&quot; ## [4] &quot;Monthly Change&quot; &quot;Year-to-Date 2021&quot; &quot;Year-to-Date 2020&quot; ## [7] &quot;Year-to-Date Change&quot; &quot;Category&quot; imp_trade_cat and imp_trade_tot have the import of goods for “August 2021”, “July 2021 (R)”, “Monthly Change”, “Year-to-Date 2021” “Year-to-Date 2020”, and “Year-to-Date Change”. We will mainly be focusing on the Year-to-Date values in our further analysis. imp_trade_cat has 137 obs. for each of the specific end-use category, wheres imp_trade_tot is a summary that only has 6 obs. for each of the principal categories. By examining these end-use categories, we will be able to have an in depth view of the State’s dependency on each category of goods’ import. Some example of categories in imp_trade_tot: ## [1] &quot;Alcoholic beverages, excluding wine&quot; &quot;Wine, beer, and related products&quot; ## [3] &quot;Food oils, oilseeds&quot; &quot;Other foods&quot; ## [5] &quot;Feedstuff and foodgrains&quot; &quot;Nuts&quot; ## [7] &quot;Cocoa beans&quot; &quot;Bakery products&quot; ## [9] &quot;Dairy products and eggs&quot; &quot;Fruits, frozen juices&quot; ## [11] &quot;Cane and beet sugar&quot; &quot;Tea, spices, etc.&quot; ## [13] &quot;Vegetables&quot; &quot;Nonagricultural foods, etc.&quot; ## [15] &quot;Fish and shellfish&quot; &quot;Green coffee&quot; ## [17] &quot;Meat products&quot; &quot;Chemicals-organic&quot; ## [19] &quot;Copper&quot; &quot;Petroleum products, other&quot; 6 Principal Categories in imp_trade_tot: ## [1] &quot;Foods, feeds, and beverages&quot; ## [2] &quot;Industrial supplies and materials&quot; ## [3] &quot;Capital goods, except automotive&quot; ## [4] &quot;Automotive vehicles, parts, and engines&quot; ## [5] &quot;Consumer goods&quot; ## [6] &quot;Other goods&quot; 3. Exhibit 7 - U.S. Exports of Goods by End-Use Category and Commodity -&gt; exp_trade_cat (128 obs. * 8 vars) -&gt; exp_trade_tot (6 obs. * 7 vars) Similar to Exhibit 8, exp_trade_cat and exp_trade_tot have the export of goods for the above variables. exp_trade_cat has 128 obs. for each of the specific end-use category, wheres exp_trade_tot is a summary that only has 6 obs. for each of the principal categories. By examining these end-use categories, we will be able to have an in depth view of what the US exports are mainly used for. 4. Exhibit 12 - U.S. Trade in Goods -&gt; us_trade_good (37 obs. * 9 vars) ## [1] &quot;Period&quot; ## [2] &quot;Balance - Total Balance of Payments Basis&quot; ## [3] &quot;Balance - Total Census Basis&quot; ## [4] &quot;Exports - Total Balance of Payments Basis&quot; ## [5] &quot;Exports - Net Adjustments&quot; ## [6] &quot;Exports - Total Census Basis&quot; ## [7] &quot;Imports - Total Balance of Payments Basis&quot; ## [8] &quot;Imports - Net Adjustments&quot; ## [9] &quot;Imports - Total Census Basis&quot; From this dataset, we extracted a us_trade_good that includes the balance, import amount and export amount of goods involved in the international trade from January 2019 to August 2021. This organized variable could serve as complementary dataset of the dataset exh1.xlsx, and further examine the proportion of goods among all imports and exports. 5. Exhibit 13 - U.S. Trade in Goods by Principal End-Use Category -&gt; us_trade_pic_export (23 obs. * 10 vars) -&gt; us_trade_pic_import (23 obs. * 10 vars) Column Names of us_trade_pic_export: ## [1] &quot;Period&quot; &quot;Total Balance of Payments Basis&quot; ## [3] &quot;Net Adjustments&quot; &quot;Total Census Basis&quot; ## [5] &quot;Foods, Feeds, &amp; Beverages&quot; &quot;Industrial Supplies (2)&quot; ## [7] &quot;Capital Goods&quot; &quot;Automotive Vehicles, etc.&quot; ## [9] &quot;Consumer Goods&quot; &quot;Other Goods&quot; us_trade_pic_export and us_trade_pic_import have the monthly Export or Import for each of the 6 principal end-use categories. The time period is from Jan. 2019 to Aug. 2021. In addition to exh7 and exh8, here we get more information about these principal end-use categories over this period of time and can therefore see their fluctuations. 6. Exhibit 14 - U.S. Trade in Goods by Selected Countries and Areas - Current Year -&gt; trade_countries_2021 (49 obs. * 11 vars) Column Names of trade_countries_2021: ## [1] &quot;Item (1)&quot; &quot;Balance August\\r\\n2021&quot; ## [3] &quot;Balance July\\r\\n2021&quot; &quot;Balance Year-to-Date\\r\\n2021&quot; ## [5] &quot;Exports August\\r\\n2021&quot; &quot;Exports July\\r\\n2021&quot; ## [7] &quot;Exports Year-to-Date\\r\\n2021&quot; &quot;Imports August\\r\\n2021&quot; ## [9] &quot;Imports July\\r\\n2021&quot; &quot;Imports Year-to-Date\\r\\n2021&quot; ## [11] &quot;Continent&quot; trade_countries_2021 has the 2021 Trade in Goods BOP data for 49 selected trading partners of US. We will be using the Year-to-Date data on export and import for different countries to visualize a geographical map that displays the trading amount of each country with US. 7. Exhibit 14a - U.S. Trade in Goods by Selected Countries and Areas - Prior Year -&gt; trade_countries_2020 (49 obs. * 11 vars) Similar to the previous one, trade_countries_2020 has the 2020 Trade in Goods BOP data for 49 selected trading partners of US. And we will be using the Year-to-Date data on export and import for different countries to plot the world map. 8. Exhibit 20 - U.S. Trade in Goods and Services by Selected Countries and Areas - BOP Basis -&gt; countries_quarters_bal (19 obs. * 10 vars) -&gt; countries_quarters_exp (19 obs. * 10 vars) -&gt; countries_quarters_imp (19 obs. * 10 vars) The original file contains the quarterly BOP of Trade in Goods and Services for 19 selected countries who are active trading partners of the US. We split it into three data sets countries_quarters_bal, countries_quarters_exp, and countries_quarters_imp that summarizes Balance, Export, and Import respectively. Each of the above data contains quarterly and annually data which allows us to make a more detailed comparison: ## [1] &quot;First Quarter\\r\\n2020&quot; &quot;Second Quarter\\r\\n2020&quot; &quot;Third Quarter\\r\\n2020&quot; ## [4] &quot;Fourth Quarter\\r\\n2020&quot; &quot;First Quarter\\r\\n2021&quot; &quot;Second Quarter\\r\\n2021&quot; ## [1] &quot;Annual\\r\\n2018&quot; &quot;Annual\\r\\n2019&quot; &quot;Annual\\r\\n2020&quot; 19 active trading partners of US included: ## [1] &quot;Brazil&quot; &quot;Canada&quot; &quot;China&quot; ## [4] &quot;France&quot; &quot;Germany&quot; &quot;Hong Kong&quot; ## [7] &quot;India&quot; &quot;Italy&quot; &quot;Japan&quot; ## [10] &quot;Korea, South&quot; &quot;Mexico&quot; &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot; ## [13] &quot;Singapore&quot; &quot;Taiwan&quot; &quot;United Kingdom&quot; ## [16] &quot;All other countries&quot; &quot;CAFTA-DR&quot; &quot;European Union&quot; ## [19] &quot;South/Central America&quot; 9.

We also generated three data sets countries_quarters_goods_bal, countries_quarters_goods_exp, and countries_quarters_goods_imp that summarizes Balance, Export, and Import respectively. 10. Exhibit 20b - U.S. Trade in Services by Selected Countries and Areas -&gt; countries_quarters_services_bal (19 obs. * 10 vars) -&gt; countries_quarters_services_exp (19 obs. * 10 vars) -&gt; countries_quarters_services_imp (19 obs. * 10 vars) Similar to Exhibit 20, this file contains the quarterly BOP for 19 selected countries who are active trading partners of the US, except that it focuses on Trade in Services only. We also generated three data sets countries_quarters_services_bal, countries_quarters_services_exp, and countries_quarters_services_imp that summarizes Balance, Export, and Import respectively. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values From this extent, according to the graphs we created above, we could easily concluded that in all data we selected in this assignment are complete without any missing value, as they are all collected from government-operating websites that guarantee comprehensiveness as well as validity. In addition, we do not need to further fulfill the missing values within them via predicted values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Section 1: From which Extent was the International Trade of the US Affected During Pre- and Post-COVID period? 5.2 Section 2: Could the spread of COVID19 account for such changes?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Section 1: From which Extent was the International Trade of the US Affected During Pre- and Post-COVID period? 5.1.1 Export in goods plunges with quick recovery 5.1.1.0.0.1 Graph 1 These two line graphs depict the fluctuations in the exports and imports of the goods and services of the US from 2019 to 2021. Within the upper bar graph, there is an obvious and sharp decline in the export amount in goods starting at February 2020. Considering the first case of COVID-19 in the US detected by CDC on 20th Jan, 2020, it could be concluded that this significant plunge temporarily coincided with the national outburst of COVID-19. Likewise, after reached a lowest ebb (around 60% of the original amount) at the middle of 2020, the export amount of the goods enjoyed a rebound to the original average at the end of this year. Similarly, the import of goods as well suffered a sudden decrease in total amount during the same time span, yet from a relatively modest extent. On the other hand, similar to those of the goods, the import and export of services were also affected during this time period yet in a rather slight extent. According to both line plots, it is pretty overt that the import and export of the services also suffered a sudden fall since February 2020, particularly the export of the services. Nevertheless, compared with the rebounded exports and imports of the goods, it took a relatively longer time for services’ trading amount to recover: till the end of the observation span, neither the import nor the export of services had returned to the original value before the outburst of COVID-19. To summarize, comparing the import and export of the goods and services, we found: From the categorical perspective, the international trading of the US in both services and goods experienced significant declines during the period from February 2020 to Dec 2020. Specifically, the imports and exports of goods, compared with those of the services, were more vulnerable in this period due to their excessive average amount. Nevertheless, the trading in the goods recovered in a much shorter term rather than that of the services. Likewise, from the aspect of trading direction, the export amount of the US suffered a much more significant loss relative to the import amount. Such phenomenon could be accounted from multiple viewpoints. As the trades in services basically depend on labor-sparse jobs, including financial services, intellectual property, telecommunications, information services etc., the pandemic was barely capable of immediately paralyzing the major producers of these services. By contrast, since the production and transportation of the goods may require intense labor, the massive outburst of COVID-19 may seriously jeopardize their source of human labor. Thus, the trading in goods were more affected during this period. On the other hand, compared with exportation, the importation of goods and services basically came from international markets or foreign producers, which were commonly multiple-sourced as well as hard-wired, and therefore were comparatively stable and robust. 5.1.2 No significant shift in product end-use 5.1.2.0.0.1 Graph 2 From these two grouped box plots, we can tell the State’s dependency on each category of goods’ import and export. All products are divided into six principal end-use categories and within each there are more sub level categories. Note that we plot the value of each subcategory as a data point here, so this graph does not suggest anything on the total value of each principal category but the underlying distribution instead. Generally, regarding both import and export, the trading amount of automotive-related products was the highest. Among all exported goods, other manufacturing products such as capital goods and industrial supplies as well occupied decent trading amounts. And among all imported goods, the general patterns are like that of exported goods, except for capital goods which takes lower value compared to export and consumer goods is ranked higher probably because of several outliers. The pattern for both 2020 and 2021 are quite similar in the sense that we do not seem to observe significant shift in values between the same pairs. However, 2021 seem to slightly outperform 2020 which suggests a recovery in the economy. We can look into these outliers within each principal categories: In terms of export, for Capital goods, except automotive, the highest value products are Semiconductors and Industrial machines; for Industrial supplies and materials, Crude Oil and Petroleum products are the highest; for Consumer goods, ‘Pharmaceutical Preparations’ is the most notable outlier. In terms of import, most outliers are the same except we are especially interested in the consumer goods division. Taking an in-depth look, we found out that besides ‘Pharmaceutical Preparations’ as the leading outlier, ‘Cell phones and other household goods’, ‘Apparel, textiles, non-wool or cotton’, and ‘Toys, games, and sporting goods’ also appear on the list. So, we can tell the production of these goods in US rely heavily on import. Hence, regarding the two box plots above, we could roughly conclude that: During the COVID-19 period, the US is mostly dependent to the imports of auto-related products, capital goods, and consumer goods, and the exports of auto-related products, capital goods, and industrial supplies. Compared with those in 2020, the imports and exports of each category of good experience an elevation in the total trading amount in 2021, which shall be considered a harbinger of recover. 5.1.3 Food stays stable while manufacturing industry is hit 5.1.3.0.0.1 Graph 3 The two faceted bar plots about the fluctuations in the imports and exports of each principal end-use category tells us how imports and exports of each good category change over time. From the temporal viewpoint, we could conclude that the plunge in trading amount of most categories of products occurred during the period from March 2020 to September 2020. Likewise, from the category-wise perspective, it is obvious that industrial supplies, capital goods, and auto-related products, categories with relatively high trading amounts, suffered tremendous fall during this period. By contrast, though most categories of goods experienced declinations in trading amounts, the exports, and imports of Foods, Feeds, and Beverages maintained stable, without any significant raise or fall. Hence, from this graph, we could summarize that: Products that the US majorly depends on all suffered serious plunges in importing and exporting amounts. All plunges occurred during the period from March 2020 to September 2020. The import and export of Foods, Feeds, and Beverages, however, remain constant during this time span. We believe that the observation Foods, Feeds, &amp; Beverages is relatively stable could be explained from two aspects: Firstly, the food category counts as life necessity, meaning the demand elasticity is high. Firms usually won’t stop the production for these goods and even if they are forced to do so in extreme situations, the government might step in and provide support or enforcement to ensure stability. Second, the production of most agricultural and food products is highly automated in the US, which means it doesn’t require lots of labor, and thus would not be affected by Covid as much. 5.1.4 Spot the close trading partners of US 5.1.4.0.0.1 Graph 4 These two geographical maps portrait the trading amount of each country with respect to US in year 2020. The value amount is very unevenly distributed. There are several major trading relationships with extremely large values, while the rest are staying below the tens (in billions of dollars). That is the reason why we choose to manually set the groups for import and exports and display it in this discrete format instead of the original continuous values. Note that the data in the original excel sheet is not inclusive of all the countries around the world, so here we only take a look at the available selection of countries. For export, the top 5 trading partners with the United States are Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany. Then in the top 10 range, we have some other European countries, as well as Brazil. For import, the top 5 trading partners with the United States are China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany. Then in the top 10 range, we have some other European countries, as well as India. One interesting correlation we can discover in this case is that in general, a close export relationship with US also indicate a close import relationship with US. In our following discussions, we will be looking into some of these close partners in detail. In addition, we can see that these top 10 trading partners are located in different continent across the world, witch include North America, South America, Asia, and Europe. So that depicts a quite diverse trade network. However, we do observe a closer trading relationship for US with countries that are adjacent geographically. From these graphs, we could conclude: The US’ trading partners are distributed mostly in the western Europe, eastern Asia, and north America. North American trading partners are high in both export and import amount. Eastern Asian states generally have relatively lower export amount yet higher import amount. 5.1.5 The hit of Covid is real especially on close trading partners 5.1.5.0.0.1 Graph 5 In the above Cleveland dot plots, we zoom in to take a further look at these close trading partner countries defined and extracted from graph 4. We first take a top level overview on the annual amount of export and import for each of the countries in the first two graphs. By juxtaposing the annual sum of year 2018, 2019, and 2020 together, it’s very obvious that the sum for 2020 is indeed the lowest among the three. This observation applies for almost every country with few exception. In particular, the top 5 trading partners are the ones that are most affected by COVID-19 in this case, as we observe significant amount of drop in both the export and import values for them. And overall import seem to be affected less than export which reaffirms our observation from previous discussions. This again suggests that the US might have undergone worse situations of pandemic compared to its trading partners, thus experiencing a deterioration in its production and supplies. Since the current year, year 2021, hasn’t been finished yet, we decide to not put it in the annual comparison graphs directly. As an alternative, we laid out the quarterly data for year 2020 and 2021 for comparison. For the first quarter, both import and export are similar between these two years. But for the second quarter, the distinction here is again quite obvious. This observation reaffirms the fact that the US international trade underwent a ‘hit and recovery’ process during the pandemic period. Hence, we could conclude that: Compared to the annual trading amounts of 2018 and 2019, that of 2020 has a significant decrease. Relative to the quarterly trading amount of 2020, that of 2021 enjoyed a rebound in the first and second quarter. The 7 closest trading partner with the US are China, Japan, Korea, Germany, the UK, Canada, and Mexico. Thus, in the following section, we would mostly focus on COVID condition in these 7 countries. 5.2 Section 2: Could the spread of COVID19 account for such changes? 5.2.1 Severity of Covid among close partners: Is it the major killer? 5.2.1.0.0.1 Graph 6 Now we’ve established close trading partners with US and identified the partners who were most affected during the pandemic period. We want to know if this could all be attributed to Covid. To understand this, we decide to take a look at the Covid situation for the top trading partner countries. The above line charts are the Covid case counts and death counts respectively for the top 7 partner countries. For the diagnosing cases, we observe a similar pattern among different countries. The lines are quite correlated in the sense that they usually peak together or with a slight delay. This is quite intuitive as the huge extent of globalization often accelerate the transmission of Covid-19. However, a more counter-intuitive observation is that countries with very high death rate such as UK and Germany are not the ones that experience the largest decrease in trading values from what we can tell in the annual plot in Graph 5. While countries with the most significant drop, such as Canada and China, don’t appear to be the most severe ones in this death counts plot. This could be due to a variety of reasons: for instance, the base trading amount is different, so a multiplying factor on the base could have effect to a different extent; the population and production mode is different, which lead to a varying response effectiveness under the Covid; and various other confounding variables such as exchange rate might also account for this reverse relationship. 5.2.2 Surprise is what shock the economy the most 5.2.2.0.0.1 Graph 7 In the combination of three plots above, we planned to compare the monthly detected COVID-19 cases in the US with the American international trades from temporal perspective, to examine whether the massive COVID-19 cases led to the declination in trading amounts. Nevertheless, according to the graphs above, it seems that the declination in trades in fact occurred during the period from February 2020 to September 2020, which was the beginning stage of COVID-19, and the detected cases were comparatively modest. By the contrast, at the globally maximal peak of COVID-19 cases at the December 2020, the corresponding trading amount was indeed recovering. Moreover, from Jan 2021 to Aug 2021, though the detected COVID-19 cases were much more excessive than those in the beginning stage, the international trades of the US in fact were enjoying an overall rejuvenation. Thus, we may conclude: The fall in trading amount mostly occur at the beginning stage of COVID-19 The rise and fall in the COVID-19 cases in the US did not indicate the trading loss. Such phenomenon may be explained from various aspects. While the COVID-19 first hit the US in early 2020, people are fully surprised and no one, both individuals and firms, are prepared for this. It provoked huge panic among the population, caused interruptions in production, and disrupted the normal supply chain and logistics. Although there is another wave of huge rise in Covid cases at the end of 2020, we can see for this time, the dent on the bar charts is much smaller compared with the previous hit. Since people are now better prepared for this situation, and plenty of measures to cope with this circumstance has emerged, it’s reasonable that the hit is no longer as impactful as before. Indeed, this fact for unexpectedness also applies to many other aspects of the economy as well, especially in the financial market. 5.2.2.0.0.2 Graph 8 In the grouped graphs above, we repeated the operation we did for US above (for Graph 7) to create faceted graph for each trading partner and compare the correlation between their trading amount with the US and the cases of COVID-19. Regarding the graphs above, we firstly observe similar patterns in COVID cases for adjacent countries or countries within the same continent. For instance, Japan and South Korea look close on their COVID case lines. And we know China in this case is a special outlier as it suffers from the pandemic earlier than most other countries, so it’s as expected to see a different pattern for China’s data. This also partially explain the issue that we had in Graph 5: as the Covid case counts for China in 2020 would be much less than other countries, directly use it in the comparison would be somewhat inaccurate to account for the drop in US-China trade amount. Likewise, we also found that, like the conclusion in graph 7, though the patterns of COVID-19’s spread were various across nations, their fluctuations in trading amount were similar: the declinations all occurred during the first or second quarter of 2020. Thus, such inconsistency also states that for the closest trading partners of the US, the accumulation of COVID-19 cases would not directly lead to the trading loss. Therefore, we may conclude that: Most trading partners of the US bore trading loss at the initial states of the COVID-19 in their countries. There is no direct correlation between the maximal COVID-19 cases and the trading loss. 5.2.2.0.0.3 Graph 9 To conclude and summarize our discussion, we put forth an improved version of the world map at the end. By combining both trading amount and Covid cases into our color scale, we obtained a more visually intuitive depiction of the interrelatedness of these two factors. For the measure that represents Covid severity, we choose the metric of Case Rate. This is defined as the number of cases per thousand people for each country. We used supplementary information from the library wpp2019 in R to determine the world population in 2020. We divided the export/import and the case rate into three levels based on their respective distribution and came up with the two-dimensional color scheme. In particular, for export, we can see that Brazil and France are two countries with high case rate and received high imports from US (US export to these countries); for import, France remains as the country with high case rate and exported a lot to the US (US import from it). Most South American countries are high in case rate but not as much engage in trading activities with US (seen as mostly red-ish), while most North American and Pacific Rim Countries are relatively low in case rate and involves in large amount of trading activities with US (seen as mostly blue-ish). For European countries, there’s a mix of behaviors and we’ll need to look into them case by case. And for African countries, the selected one shown in this graph appear to outperform most countries in terms of case rate but be aware that they are not representative of the whole picture for the African continent. It’s generally recognized that African countries are not very strong trading partners with the US and this is confirmed by their light purple-ish color.

This interactive graph has two components: the upper part is a bar chart displaying the importing and exporting amount of each category of product in a specific time range (this part of data comes from the ft900xlsx/exh6.xlsx), and the lower part is a line plot displaying the number of COVID-19 cases (this part of data comes from the COVID-19Data/dataset 2/data.csv). The purpose of the interactive graph is to let the audience see the fluctuation in the trading amount over time. Moreover, audiences could actively compare the trading amount at each stage of COVID-19’s spread. For instance, via simple movements, you could compare the importing and exporting amounts during December 2020, when the detected cases of COVID-19 reached its global maximum, and those during March or April 2020, when the COVID-19 initially appeared in the US. 6.3 Instructions for Using the Interactive Graph Initially, the upper graph would be blank, and the lower graph displayed a red line indicating the detected cases of COVID-19 in the US. Then, you could land you mouse in any region in the lower graph. As soon as you land your mouse on a section of it, the current region would turn grey, and red and navy-blue bars would appear on the upper graph, indicating that you are currently observing a specific time zone. To compare the trading condition from time to time, you can just move your mouse to another region in the lower graph, and then observe how the bars in the upper graph shrink and stretch. Note: As this graph is comparatively tall, you had better zoom out to see it as a whole. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Conducted Conclusion 7.2 Observed Obstacles 7.3 Further Focuses 7.4 Learnt Lessons", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Conducted Conclusion Consistent with all graphs and comments above, we could now answer the questions we raised at the beginning of this project. As the results presented in the first section demonstrated, during the rampant spread of COVID-19, the US indeed bore an undoubtedly significant loss in its international trade, both export and import, both goods and services. Moreover, considering the goods’ categories, we can also summarize that the major goods the US depends on suffered the greatest plunge in the trading amounts, compared with the data in previous years. Thus, we could say that along COVID-19’s spreading period, the international trading of the US indeed encountered a tremendous hindrance in both quality and quantity. However, simply the spread of COVID-19 could not fully explain the changing pattern of the international trading amount of the US as well as the current product shortages. First, despite of the loss of trading amount at the initial outburst of COVID-19 in the US, the import and export of goods and services soon rejuvenated right after the huge plunge. Besides, though it is commonly argued that the labor shortage caused by the widespread of COVID-19 led to the productivity deficiency, in fact, when the detected cases in the US reached its global maximum, the export and import of this nation were recovering back to the original level of the pre-COVID era. Moreover, regarding COVID-19’s spread in the US’ closest trading partners, we also found that the declination in their trades with the US mostly occurred at the beginning stage of COVID-19’s spread rather than its developing or worsening stages. In conclusion, the international trade of the US indeed suffered a severe plunge at the beginning of the COVID epoch, yet it may be too arbitrary to exclusively attribute the US’ loss in international trade and the recent shortage in goods to simply the global spread of COVID-19. On the other hand, by our prediction, the global panic induced by this unexpected virus as well as the following trading blocks, traveling prohibition, as well as negative public cries shall play more significant roles during this historical event. 7.2 Observed Obstacles Nevertheless, we additionally found that our exploration in this research question somehow limited from the following perspectives: In our first section, we discussed the fluctuations in trading amount of each type of goods as well as their importance. Nevertheless, we could not dig deeper in the direction to examine which country is mostly responsible for which sort of good due to the lack of data. In our second section, due to the constraint of the data format, we could not explicitly extract the exact monthly trading amount of each trading partner yet only the quarterly data, which led to the slight ambiguity of the result. Since all our datasets are composed by numeric data, we could not produce some categorical plots or find the inner correlation between probably critical factors. 7.3 Further Focuses To further explore probable triggers of the recent goods shortage in the US, we decide to improve our exploratory approaches from the following perspectives: First and foremost, we would like to enlarge the span of our data. Previously, we merely concerned the COVID-19’s cases and death as well as the international trading amount. In further studies, we would possibly include data about other crucial factors affecting the international trades, such as public opinions, USD’s exchange rate, or average wages of labors. In addition, we may focus on presenting and relating the data from various viewpoints. For instance, we may transform some numeric data into categorical data (such as labeling them as high, low, medium), and then seek their possible correlations via paired graphs. 7.4 Learnt Lessons Within this project, we obtained some inspirations in EDAV as well: Firstly, we learnt that the selection of the dataset is even more critical than displaying them. At the beginning of this project, we spent most of our time seeking the most inclusive as well as tidy dataset, and eventually found these government-published data, which had seldom missing values as well as well-organized formats. Had we merely selected a common dataset at that time, we would not only have spent countless time to fix the missing values and tidy the format, but also have been questioned about the validity of the data sources and conclusions. Moreover, we also learnt that the coincidence might not indicate the correlation. Before conducting this study, we both considered that it was the spread of COVID-19 in the US leading to the shortages in labor and goods. Nevertheless, after this project, we now knew that simply COVID-19 might not fully account to this economic abnormality.
